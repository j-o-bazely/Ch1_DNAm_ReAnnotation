# This is an array script that aligns the reads of each sample to the Chang reference genome 


# This script puts each sampe through one of two pathways:
    # 1: Runs from multiple 

####        Environment Preparation         ####
## Load necesasry modules
module load bismark # v.0.22.1
module load samtools/1.9 # v.1.10 has incompatible gcc with bismark module

## Specify the number of cores to use
REPCORES=$((NSLOTS/2))
echo "cores: ${REPCORES}"

## Move into top Ch1.ReMap directory (Assuming this script is being run from the script directory)
echo "Moving to top dir"
cd ..
echo "Currently in: $(pwd)"

## Loading sample list to create array
sample_list=$(pwd)/Metadata/Ch1.ReMap_SampleList.txt

## Extract sample ID ##
SAMPLE=$(sed -n "${SGE_TASK_ID}p" $sample_list)
echo "task ID: ${SGE_TASK_ID}"
echo "Running sample: ${SAMPLE}"

## Set directories
READS_DIR=/data/SBCS-EizaguirreLab/James_B/cleanPHD/Ch1_dataStorage/Ch1_inputData/Ch1.M_rawData/$SAMPLE
GENOME_DIR=/data/SBCS-EizaguirreLab/James_B/cleanPHD/Ch1_dataStorage/Ch1.ReMap_data/Ch1.ReMap.1_data
OUT_DIR=/data/SBCS-EizaguirreLab/James_B/cleanPHD/Ch1_dataStorage/Ch1.ReMap_data/Ch1.ReMap.2_data/bams/$SAMPLE

## Create outdir for bams
mkdir -p $OUT_DIR
