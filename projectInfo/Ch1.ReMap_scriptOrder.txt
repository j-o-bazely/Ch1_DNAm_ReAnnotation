This is a guide to the workflow for this repository. Every point will reference the chronological script in the analysis, what that script does and why we do it.

More in-depth documentation can be found within the scripts, with each script including detailed commenting for each code block



#1 Ch1.ReMap.1_genomePrep.sh
	- Uses bismark_genome_preparation to create the files necessary for Bismark to properly align reads to the genome later in the pipeline


#2 Ch1.ReMap.2_Bismarkalign.sh
	- Uses bismark to align methylation reads to the genome prepared in the previous step.
	- Outputs bam files which will then undergo methylation calling


#3 Ch1.ReMap.3_trimmedQC.sh
	- QC analysis of trimmed, deduplicated, merged reads to assess quality 
	  before downstream analysis 

#4 Ch1.ReMap.4_MethCalling.sh
	- Calling of methylated CpG in bam files output from alignment, 
	- Ends
